title: "Introducing Me: Green as Grass"

Hello the internet, my name is Simon New and I have absolutely no coding experience! Ok, that may be a little bit of an exaggeration as I am pretty confident with manipulating excel workbooks using formulae, but aside from that, my coding experience is non-existent.

As of writing this post I am 29 and working as a Senior Development Scientist developing diagnostic products for the clinical sector. In plain English, the products I design are mostly used to detect multi-drug resistant microorganisms from patients upon entering hospital prior to operations. I have been in this role for roughly 6 years now do still enjoy it. Science aside, I can often be found pulling stupid faces with my bands. My love of music is probably why I have not given coding a chance so far.

So why am I here? In the last 12 months, my work has become more focused on processing large volumes of data, which is taking a long time to do manually. In addition, I have recently been listening to a lot of podcasts relating to automation via coding, data science, cyber security, ethical hacking and have become inspired. Coincidentally, around the same time I went on holiday and became friends with a software engineer and met some Finish colleagues who all were competent coders. These experiences convinced me to at least try getting my feet wet with coding.

What follows will hopefully be a series of blog posts that describe the journey I am about to embark upon, the resources I have used, real life projects I have set myself and the resulting code that I have written. I do not know where I will end up by taking these first steps, but I am excited to find out.


Footnote: Ok, confession time. I actually started my coding journey around September 2017. So in case you feel I have picked up a lot incredibly quickly, the next few blog posts will be me catching up with my experience and decisions to date. I will make a note when I am all caught up.
