title: Why Python?
---
Approaching coding as a complete novice I quickly came to the realisation that I would need to make an informed choice as to which language to learn. My initial thought was ‘Oh, I’ll just learn the newest one or the one that’s most widely used’. Well, the upshot of that is that there are a handful of languages that are currently used widely, all of which have different pros and cons.  So, first big question down this rabbit hole; what do you want to do with coding? My answer; gather and analyse large volumes of data, automate repetitive tasks, design some cool software that I can’t find online for issues I’ve encountered.  

I am lucky that I work for a large company and many of my R&D colleagues overseas have vast coding experience. After discussions with them, it became evident that either Python or R would be most appropriate. Further discussions with external contacts working in a scientific field also threw back Python. It seemed wise to listen to my colleagues who have far more experience than myself. With this split between Python and R I took to the internet. Python boasts simple to read, yet powerful coding whereas R is one of the most established languages for scientific analysis. 

I had a play around with both Python and R, but found Python’s syntax to be much more appealing and straight forward. As I’m learning in my spare time, a straight forward syntax was a big plus.  Logic aside, there was also an inexplicable pull towards Python once I’d begun to research it properly. The language takes inspiration from Monty Python and references to show on all possible occasions as well having light-hearted philosophy, such as “we are all consenting adults here”. This approach definitely appealed to me.

So Python it is. From my conversations and own research this language seemed like a good choice for my aims. Time will tell if it is as powerful as the community says. I’m still ahead of this blog with my learning and spoiler alert, the community wasn’t lying!
