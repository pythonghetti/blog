title: A Little Mention for Java
---
Writing this blog retrospectively means I may have glossed over a small fact. Before I’d spoken to my colleagues and properly figured out what I’d like to achieve with coding, I’d spent a couple of months learning to code with Java. 

I’m actually quite glad I went down the Java route first as it really did highlight the simplicity of Python syntax. For instance, here’s the classic “hello world” code in the two languages.

Code to print “hello world” in Java:

public class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, World");
    }
}

Code to print “hello world” in Python:

print(“hello world”)

As well as highlighting the syntax differences, having a dabble with Java was a great way to be introduced to some of the concepts of coding. Java also shares a number of common features with Python. 

If you’d like to learn Java, this blog probably isn’t for you but  I’d recommend giving Trevor Page’s tutorials and podcasts a go.  His podcast is called “how to program with Java” and all the resources are on his website: https://howtoprogramwithjava.com/. In addition, I’d recommend downloading an app called ‘SoloLearn’ for your phone. This contains excellent tutorials for Java (and Python) all of which are free. I’ll mention SoloLearn in a later post as it’s great for Python.
